# Terminator

## Compiling Games
1. Read scene path from game.yml
2. In scene path
    - Generate an ID for each scene
    - Replace scene path links with the scene's ID
    - Somehow get all scenes into a single JS object with IDs for keys
    - When a scene references another it will be pulled up from the tree


## Game scripting format
- Specify snippets with ways to redirect to different ones based on user input (dialogue trees)
